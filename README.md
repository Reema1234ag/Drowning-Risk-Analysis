# Drowning-Risk-Analysis
When we started looking at the statistics about drowning deaths, we noticed that drowning is the second leading cause of death especially for children under 15. Even if they are under the supervision of guardian but a slightest ignorance can result into disaster.1.2 million people around the world die or get injured by drowning every year, i.e more than 2 people per minute.
Thus our project would be very useful in the school swimming pools for the kids who are not so used to of swimming. It would be very useful in saving the lives of kids. It also helps in places where even adult drowning risk is high.
Unsupervised places for swimming are death traps since there is no one to educate and manage the crowd or to assist and alert in case of an emergency. So, it will help in preventing the risk factor. As a whole nothing can be more important than saving oneâ€™s life.



Using YOLO object detection, this program will detect whether a person is drowning or not. This software can be used with a Raspberry Pi Camera, which can then be placed underwater with an appropriate case.
The algorithm consists of three core steps: pre-processing, objects-detection and drowning detection.
